# eland-frontend

Frontend application for the Eland project built using **React** + **Vite**.

## About

**eland-frontend** is the UI layer for the Eland system. It provides:

- A fast development workflow with hot module reloading (HMR) via Vite  
- Clean project structure to scale components, pages, and services  
- Out-of-the-box linting rules (ESLint) and code quality assurance  
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling  
- Flexible configuration and environment support  

You can view a live demo (if deployed) at:  
[eland-frontend.vercel.app](https://eland-frontend.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn  

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esteham/eland-frontend.git
cd eland-frontend
npm install
````

(Or if you prefer yarn: `yarn install`)

### Running Locally (Development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the app (usually at `http://localhost:3000` or similar).

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist/` folder.

To preview the build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

You can expand or reorganize this layout as your app grows (e.g. adding stores, hooks, contexts, utils).

---

## Configuration & Environment

* Place environment-specific variables in `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`, etc.
* For example, your API base URL, feature flags, etc.
* Ensure `VITE_` prefixed variables are used (so Vite injects them).

---

## Linting & Formatting

* ESLint is configured to enforce code quality and consistency.
* You can run linting via:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
* You may also add `prettier` or other formatting tools if desired.

If you like, I can generate a customized README based on more of the actual features, routes, APIs, or tech stack of your project (if you share them). Do you want me to draft that?
